# patchworm
eternalblue worm that spreads over the subnet and delivers kb4012212 which is the patch for eternalblue (the leaked nsa exploit that has caused over 14 billion\n dollars in damages globaly... SO FAR, its still going).\n
patchworm.exe can be double clicked and it will patch your whole network with "the double click of a button" a 90 year old man could use this its very very easy\n
its stupid easy to use, and you dont have to go and manualy update every single desktop\n
if i were to put this on public it would need another day or 2 of debugging,
its not very reliable but it works most of the time.
also dont take this as more than it is,
5 hours of my life + 2 monster energy drinks = python script
