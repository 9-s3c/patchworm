# patchworm
eternalblue worm that spreads over the subnet and delivers kb4012212 which is the patch for eternalblue (the leaked nsa exploit that has caused over 14 billion\n dollars in damages globaly... SO FAR, its still going).\n
patchworm.exe can be double clicked and it will patch your whole network with "the double click of a button" a 90 year old man could use this its very very easy\n
idk if il make this public due to the fact that its easy to turn into a "bad guy program" even if someone has 0 skills\n
i wont i dont think, lol i just save allot of my stuff on here\n
it may be usefull in the future cause its stupid easy to use, and you dont have to go and manualy update every single desktop\n
and if you dont have manage engine and you are in a hospital or large network its not something you can realy do without a loss.\n
police stations, hospitals, critical infustructure none of them can realy take downtime to install patches, sometimes they can but rarely\n
thats why if you walk into a police station they still use win7, so this could be a solution but im not sure\n
and it could easily do more harm than good if the wrong person finds it\n
